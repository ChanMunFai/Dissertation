    "Challenges\n",
    "- When rotating an image, by default, we may rotate it from the center. \n",
    "- However, that is not the same as just rotating the object. \n",
    "- Thus, when we combine rotations and shifts, the shifts do not really work because the rotatations undo some of the shifting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed solution: \n",
    "- Use a different package for rotation, which allows us to rotate the image according to a center. \n",
    "- This center will be the center of the object (digit) and we will keep track of this center according to our shifts. \\"
