We will use BouncingBall_50 as the standard dataset. 
- BouncingBall_100 will be used to check for long term predictions 

Things to do 
1. Plot predictions according to specified time steps (rather than consecutive)
2. Retrain hierachical models for levels > 2 because the previous models did not use the latent levels 
3. Train VRNN model on BouncingBall_50 using encoder decoder architecture from KalmanVAE.
