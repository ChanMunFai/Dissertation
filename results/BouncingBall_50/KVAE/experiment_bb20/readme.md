Used a model that was only trained on 20 observations. However, during inference, all 50 observations are fed into the model. 

Model used is  "saves/BouncingBall_20/kvae/v1/attempt2/scale=0.3/scheduler_step=20/kvae_state_dict_scale=0.3_60.pth"

# Comments 
- Do not have the same weird artefacts that appear when I use a model that was trained on 50 sequences
